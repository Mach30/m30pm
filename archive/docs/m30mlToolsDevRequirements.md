# M30 ML Tools Dev Requirements

1. Cross-platform builds, anywhere NPM/Yarn run
2. Language is known by M30 peeps (or is quick to pick up)
3. Stong process management (supporting cross-platform management of external tools)
4. Support for well known and well supported text templating engine (currently using shopify's Liquid)
5. Support distribution of user "compiled" app (e.g. not Python)
6. Would be nice to have support for GUI and web development (to support future work)
7. The environment itself is under active support and development
