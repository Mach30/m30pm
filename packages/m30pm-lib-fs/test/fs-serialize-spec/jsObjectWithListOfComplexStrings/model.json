    "Mary had a little lamb,\nIt's fleece was white as snow;\nAnd everywhere that Mary went\nThe lamb was sure to go.", 
    "He followed her to school one day\nWhich was against the rule;\nIt made the children laugh and play,\nTo see a lamb at school.", 
    "And so the teacher turned him out,\nBut still he lingered near;\nAnd waited patiently about\nTill Mary did appear", 
    "\"What makes the lamb love Mary so?\""
